Imagine this:

Instead of renting a room in someone else’s mansion…

You build your own cabin -- simple, solid, tucked away in your own private land.

You pick the layout, the locks, the view. It doesn’t rely on anyone else’s power, policies, or monthly bill.

It’s yours.

That’s what self-hosted technology really is.

It’s not about complexity -- it’s about ownership.
And in a world that increasingly rents out every part of your digital life…

This matters.

So if you’ve ever wondered:
	•	Could I run my own cloud?
	•	Could I store my own files?
	•	Could I build something that’s mine from the ground up?

The answer is yes -- and I’m going to show you how.

Not with a subscription.
Not with a giant tech company.

Just you, and the right tools.
