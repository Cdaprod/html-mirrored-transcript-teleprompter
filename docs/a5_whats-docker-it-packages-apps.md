Perfect. Part 5 is your audience’s first hands-on mental model.
This is where you give them the "a-ha!" that makes the rest of the course make sense.

You’re not just teaching Docker -- you’re showing how developers actually use it to package and run apps anywhere. And more importantly, why it removes all the scary parts for someone new.

Part 5: What’s Docker? It Packages Apps.

(~2–3 min -- metaphor, demo context, and simplified architecture)

⸻

[Voiceover / Script Draft]

"Alright. Now that you know what storage is, and why we’re using MinIO…

We’re almost ready to deploy it.

But before that, let’s talk about one more tool that’ll make all of this simple -- even if you’ve never set up a server before:

Docker."

⸻

[Metaphor Explanation]

"Docker is like a shipping container for apps.

Let’s say you want to run an app -- like MinIO, or a database, or even your own website.

In the past, you’d have to:
	•	Install a bunch of dependencies
	•	Worry about versions
	•	Configure everything manually

It was like trying to bake a cake using someone else’s kitchen -- without knowing where anything is.

But with Docker?
You just grab the container. It has everything inside.
	•	The app
	•	The configs
	•	The right versions
	•	The dependencies

And when you run it, it just… works."

[Overlay: Docker Container Visual]

Show:
[App] + [Dependencies] + [Settings] → Docker Image → Docker Container (running app)

Label the container: "Runs anywhere -- Mac, Linux, Cloud, Pi"

⸻

"So when I say we’re going to deploy MinIO using Docker, what I mean is:
We’re going to pull a pre-built container -- one that already has MinIO inside -- and run it on your machine.

No install headaches.
No package manager nightmares.
No weird setup steps."

⸻

"In fact -- in just one command, you’ll be running your own cloud storage server."

⸻

[Optional Mini-Preview (not tutorial)]

Show:
docker run -p 9000:9000 minio/minio ...

Don’t explain it yet -- just show the confidence: "This is it."

⸻

"That’s the power of Docker.
It takes complex systems -- and makes them portable, repeatable, and easy to understand.

And that’s exactly what we’ll use to run MinIO."

⸻

This sets up the transition to:

Part 6: Deploying MinIO with Docker Compose (actual screencast)

⸻

Optional Assets I Can Help With:
	•	Docker Container Anatomy visual (Figma + PNG)
	•	CLI overlay for docker run + docker-compose.yml
	•	A "Before Docker vs After Docker" diagram

Let me know -- want to move straight into Part 6 and build the deploy tutorial walkthrough?
