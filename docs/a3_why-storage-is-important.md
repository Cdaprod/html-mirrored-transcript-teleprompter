Let’s go.
Now that you’ve hooked them with ownership, and cracked open "what even is an app?" -- it’s time to hit them with the first real piece of infrastructure knowledge that anyone can understand and everyone can build: storage.

Part 3: Why Storage Is the Foundation of Every App

(~2 min, metaphor + tech explanation + payoff)

⸻

[Voiceover / Script Draft]

"Alright -- now that we know what an app really is, let’s talk about the very first building block behind every single one of them:

Storage.

Think of storage like memory.
If your app can’t remember things, it’s not useful.

Imagine:
	•	A chat app that forgets your messages
	•	A banking app that forgets your transactions
	•	A camera that deletes every photo right after you take it

Every app needs to store something.
Files, photos, passwords, logs, user preferences, events, uploads, outputs -- data is everywhere.

⸻

[Metaphor Visual Overlay #1]

Show 3 apps:
	•	Chat app: "stores messages"
	•	Notes app: "stores text"
	•	YouTube: "stores video uploads + views"

Then reveal:
"All of it goes into storage. Sometimes a database, sometimes an object store, sometimes both."

⸻

"In modern apps -- especially cloud-native ones -- that storage is often object storage.

Think of it like putting things into labeled buckets.
Not spreadsheets. Not tables. Just stuff: images, PDFs, videos, JSON files, logs."

And this is where a lot of people hit a wall -- because traditional cloud storage means:
	•	You need an AWS account
	•	You’re on a meter
	•	You give up control

But you don’t have to.

In this course, I’m going to show you how to run your own storage system --
fast, S3-compatible, secure, private.

So whether you’re building an app, backing up your files, or feeding an AI model…
your data is yours -- and your storage is solid."

Part 4: What is S3? How apps use it.

And then → MinIO as your self-hosted replacement

⸻

Want to Visualize This with:
	•	A custom animated "bucket" graphic (e.g. showing uploads dropping in)?
	•	A split-screen showing S3 interface vs. a terminal-based MinIO demo?
	•	Or a diagram of a simple app’s stack with arrows to storage?

Let’s decide the visual language for this series and I’ll generate assets or storyboard the entire video with you. Ready for Part 4 next?
