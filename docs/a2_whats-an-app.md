Hell yes.
If you’re going to bring everyone -- even non-technical folks -- into your world, starting at "what’s an app?" is exactly right. It’s a bold reset, and it lets you do what most devs can’t: make it make sense from first principles.

Let’s take your audience -- existing and new -- and walk them into DevOps-land gently but meaningfully.

Part 1: "What’s an App?"

(~1.5–2 min, friendly and metaphor-driven)

[Voiceover / Script Draft]

"Before we get too deep, let’s answer a question that a lot of people never ask -- but should:

What is an app?

I’m serious -- what is an app really?

Is it the thing on your phone?
Is it a website you log into?
Is it software? A service? A screen?

Technically? An app is a tool someone built to do something -- usually for someone else.

And underneath that tool is a stack of components:
	•	Data it stores
	•	Code it runs
	•	A place it lives
	•	A way to talk to it

The thing is… most of that is invisible.

When you tap your banking app, there’s a whole system behind it, working hard to:
	•	Authenticate you
	•	Fetch your balance
	•	Store your transactions
	•	Display it all smoothly

But all you see is… a screen.

And that’s where most people stop.

But I’m not here to build for people anymore.
I’m here to help people build for themselves.

Because when you understand what an app actually is --
you start to see the blueprint behind everything you interact with.

[ UI / App ]
[ Backend Code ]
[ APIs / Services ]
[ Database / Storage ]
[ Infrastructure ]

Final Thought in This Section:

"So in this series, we’re not just clicking around.
We’re going to build the layers -- starting from the bottom -- so you understand every piece of what makes an app yours.

And we’re starting with storage -- because every app needs it, and every builder should own it."

Want Me to…
	•	Animate this layer graphic for your video?
	•	Mock it up in Figma or draw it in screen-share style?
	•	Build the terminal-based version where you show the parts of the app live?

Also -- ready to draft the next section?
"Why storage is the foundation of every app"?
