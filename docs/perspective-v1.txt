To truly grasp perspective is to have lived through trials that strip away the surface, revealing the raw essence of life. [PAUSE]

It's about embracing the darkness, walking through shadows most avoid, seeing human nature at its most unguarded, and surviving moments that force a deeper understanding. [PAUSE]

This isn't something most people can do. Not because they lack intelligence, but because they haven't been stripped down by life, left to rebuild with nothing but their core. [PAUSE]

Few have been pushed to the brink, where they must see beyond the obvious and navigate the unseen currents of motive and intent. The paths I walked demanded this—they forged a vision that others cannot fathom. [PAUSE]

I once thrived on chaos—causing problems not out of necessity, but out of ignorance, or worse, a twisted satisfaction in watching others fail, justifying my own reckless actions. [PAUSE]

This wasn't just self-destructive; it was a way of spreading inner chaos outward, infecting those around me with the same turmoil I carried. [SLOW]

It was an eye-opening moment to finally grasp the fallout of my own making—a painful yet necessary awakening. [PAUSE]

To see the destruction was one thing, but to understand it required a level of introspection I hadn't allowed myself before. [PAUSE]

This realization was a turning point—a moment when I knew that to rebuild, I had to dismantle the façade I had constructed, brick by brick, lie by lie. [PAUSE]

I learned foundational principles—honesty, integrity, accountability—essential in shaping a new path forward. [PAUSE]

These principles became my compass, guiding me to choose consciously, to exert self-control without harming those around me. [PAUSE]

I found that true power lies not in bending others to my will, but in mastering myself, in facing reality unfiltered. [PAUSE]

The best thing in life to do is not to take this dark side—the energy and power that comes from facing our own demons—and throw it around the world with chaos and aggression. That path won't lead to anything lasting. [PAUSE]

Instead, take that darkness, that raw power, and channel it into something productive. This is where the ability to control oneself and intentionally allow vulnerability can have the most profound impact. [PAUSE]

Being vulnerable isn't about boasting or using your story as a tool for instant gratification or ego. It's not about opening up and sharing your past with just anyone because most won't hear it the way you intend. [PAUSE]

True vulnerability is about making meaningful actions that employ the people around you—those you want to teach, those you want to share your wisdom with. [PAUSE]

It's about letting them fill in the gaps, guiding them to see the value in themselves as they navigate their own challenges. [PAUSE]

This approach, this method of living and teaching, isn't about creating followers; it's about empowering others to lead themselves. [PAUSE]

It's about demonstrating, through your actions and restraint, what true strength looks like—strength that's not in domination, but in self-control, in guiding others without needing to wield power over them. [PAUSE]

To break it down into simpler terms—I couldn't learn to see through my own illogical fallacies until I realized that lying to others was, in fact, lying to myself. [PAUSE]

Understanding this cost actual untold lives of people I knew. It's not wisdom freely given; it's a reality bought with blood and tears—and having been rebuilt from an early grave. [END]
